The objective of this project is to develop a desktop application tailored to aid a virtual industrial construction company called Vertex Group Solutions in handling its customer orders. 
Specifically, the tasks include establishing a database for storing and managing order and client details, as well as creating user-friendly graphical interfaces for flexible interaction with the database. 
This entails granting administrative personnel the ability to conduct diverse operations related to client and order management, while enabling customers to oversee their own orders.
